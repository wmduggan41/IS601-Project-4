# IS 601 Final Project

My final project was to create a flask application that is based on the tutorial found at https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application.  

Data for the project is based on an earlier project, found on my GitHub at https://github.com/wmduggan41/IS601-Project-3.
